# Using Computer Vision to Automate Top Plans


Through the use of OpenCV and other tools, I used computer vision tecniques to scan underwater terrains and highlight all significant objects that weren't the ocean floor. Normally, this is a slow tedious process done by hand by trained archeologists. With my program, now all you have to do is input an ortho photo and it will return an accurate top plan back instantly. This saves time, money, and makes archeologists job that much easier.
